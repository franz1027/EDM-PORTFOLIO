## About Me
Hi there! I'm a first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I am passionate about the study and application of Information Science, a field that combines my interests in technology, data, and human interaction. I find it fascinating how information, in all its forms, plays such a vital role in shaping decisions, processes, and innovations across industries and sectors.

As I progress in my studies, I'm excited to dive deeper into areas like data management, software development, and network systems. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others, share ideas, and grow my skills. I’m also always on the lookout for opportunities to apply what I’m learning in real-world scenarios, whether through internships, projects, or just staying updated with the latest tech trends.

When I’m not studying, I like to explore new tech innovations, play around with coding projects, and participate in hackathons. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and eventually contribute to creating innovative solutions that drive efficiency and success for businesses.

I’m excited about the journey ahead and the chance to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology!
